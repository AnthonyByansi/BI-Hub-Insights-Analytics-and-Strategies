# Data Modelling

## What is Data Modelling?

Data Modelling is the process of creating a data model for the data to be stored in a database. This data model is a conceptual representation of Data objects, the associations between different data objects, and the rules. Data Modelling helps in the visual representation of data and enforces business rules, regulatory compliances, and government policies on the data.

## Key Concepts in Data Modelling

1. **Entity**: An entity represents a real-world object that is being modeled. In terms of databases, an entity often corresponds to a table.

2. **Attribute**: An attribute is a property or characteristic of an entity. In terms of databases, an attribute often corresponds to a column in a table.

3. **Relationship**: A relationship describes how entities interact. For example, a 'works for' relationship might exist between an employee entity and a company entity.

4. **Normalization**: This is the process of efficiently organizing data in a database. It involves eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency.

5. **ER Diagram**: Entity-Relationship Diagram is a diagram that represents the structure of a database in terms of entities, their attributes, and the relationships between entities.

## Importance of Data Modelling

Data Modelling is crucial in ensuring that data objects provided by functional team are represented accurately. It provides a clear picture of the data objects and their relationships, which helps in maintaining data integrity and optimizing performance.

## Tools for Data Modelling

There are many tools available for data modelling, ranging from simple diagramming tools to more complex data modelling software. Some popular data modelling tools include ER/Studio, Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect, and Microsoft Visio.
