# BI Reporting

## What is BI Reporting?

BI Reporting (Business Intelligence Reporting) is a process used in businesses for data analysis of raw data provided by various data sources. BI Reporting processes allow for the easy interpretation of these volumes of data to support business decisions.

## Key Concepts in BI Reporting

1. **Dashboards**: A BI dashboard is a data visualization tool that displays on one screen the status of key performance indicators (KPIs) and other important business metrics and data points for an organization, department, team or process.

2. **Scorecards**: A scorecard is another data visualization tool that displays performance metrics but is more focused on tracking strategic goals and objectives.

3. **Ad-hoc Reports**: Ad hoc reporting is a business intelligence process designed to answer a single, specific business question. The product of ad hoc analysis is typically a statistical model, analytic report, or other type of data summary.

4. **Operational Reports**: These reports are more detailed than the other types of reports. They are used to monitor the detailed activities of the business.
